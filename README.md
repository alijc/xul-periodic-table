xul-periodic-table
==================

A series of pages that show the widgets available for XUL.


I wrote this a number of years ago as an experiment to see what could be done with XUL. At that time you could simply browse to http://www.hevanet.com/acorbin/xul/top.xul with a gecko-based browser (such as firefox) and the content would render inside the browser.  But more recent versions of firefox have disallowed external xul as a security issue.


A number of people have taken the original code and repackaged it into more usable forms.  While correcting my errors at the same time.  You can find these newer packages here:
